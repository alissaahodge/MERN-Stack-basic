# MERN Stack  `(MongoDb, Express ,React, Node)`

## About 
MERN stack is a web development framework. It consists of MongoDB - document database. Express(.js) - Node.js web framework. React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework. Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server.

I have created this MERN stack template with basic features so that this can be used as a base for future projects using the MERN Stack.

The features included on this stack include:

- Fully functioning auth (login, sign up , google auth signup/login)
- Home page
- Dashboard
- basic posts module
- user account settings
